# Compiler in C

## Ana Lilia Carballido Camacateco

This project aims to implement a compiler with all its stages using the **C** programming language.
The developed compiler processes a language created for academic purposes, going through the following stages:

- Lexical analysis
- Semantic analysis
- Syntax analysis

For this project, the **GitHub Flow** branching strategy will be used.
